# fork-syncer
Automation to keep the repositories I've forked up to date. Most times I will fork a project to make a specific change, and after it is merged, my fork will drift from upstream changes. Iterating over the values in the [forks](forks) file, a github action using the [fork-sync](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/fork-sync) action to create PRs for specific repository/forks.

If you'd like to use this automation, fork this project, and change the values in the [forks](forks) file to match the forks you want to keep in sync with upstream.

```bash

```
